# Low-level programming with C

Module of **Low-level programming**, carried out during **[ALX's](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full Stack Software Engineering Program**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* C files are written and compiled according to the gnu89 standard
